## 🎯 The Problem

Current Soroban development relies heavily on CLI tools, creating barriers for:

- Developers new to blockchain development
- Teams needing visual debugging tools
- Quick contract testing and interaction
- Real-time transaction monitoring

**Soroban DevConsole bridges this gap** with an intuitive web interface that makes Soroban development more accessible and efficient.
